<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  This is an HTML comment! The browser won't render this.
  I'll describe things in this HTML file using these.
  The doctype above tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
  Most browsers don't require this anymore, but it is good practice to have.

<html>

  <!-- The HEAD element contains assorted metadata about the document. -->
  <head>
    <title>Trevor's Website</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This content will show up as the description of your site in search results.">
    <meta name="author" content="Trevor William Foehl">

    <!-- The HEAD element can also contain links to external resources, like these styles! -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">

  <!-- The BODY element contains everything you actually see in the browser. -->
  <body>

    <!-- HTML consists of nested "elements" that may have zero to many "attributes" -->
    <!-- Every element has a different purpose. These H1 and H2 elements below are headers. Headers are numbered H1 - H6. -->
    <h1>Trevor's Awesome Website!</h1>
    <h2>Itsn't it cool?</h2>

    <!-- These buttons have class and id attributes set! Their values are referenced in our CSS and JS -->

# Hi Trev!
## Welcome to your development playground repository!

You should probably read up about Markdown, that is what any file with a `.md` file extension contains â€“ like this one!

[Read about markdown here!](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Remember that JavaScript files end with a `.js` file extension, CSS files end with `.css` and HTML files end in `.html`.

 1. HTML is the bones of a website. It is the content and structure.
 2. CSS is the hair skin clothing of a website. It is look, feel, and style.
 3. JavaScript is the muscles and brain of a website. It is the functionality and logic.
